I'll help you set up remote deployment for your WinUI 3 project. Remote deployment is useful for testing your application on different machines without manually transferring the installation files.

## Setting Up Remote Deployment for a WinUI 3 Application

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to deploy your WinUI 3 application to a remote test machine:

### Prerequisites

1. Both your development machine and the remote test machine must be running Windows 10/11
2. Both machines must be on the same network
3. Remote tools must be installed on the test machine
4. Developer Mode must be enabled on both machines

### Step 1: Enable Developer Mode on Both Machines

On both your development machine and remote test machine:

1. Open **Settings**
2. Go to **Privacy & Security** > **For developers**
3. Turn on **Developer Mode**

### Step 2: Install Remote Tools on the Test Machine

1. Download the Visual Studio Remote Tools that match your VS version
   - For Visual Studio 2022: [Remote Tools for VS 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#remote-tools-for-visual-studio-2022)
   - Make sure to match the architecture (x86/x64/ARM64) with your development machine

2. Install the Remote Tools package on the test machine
3. Start the Remote Debugger by searching for "Remote Debugger" in the Start menu
4. Make note of the port number shown in the Remote Debugger window (default is 4024)

### Step 3: Configure Your WinUI 3 Project for Remote Deployment

1. Open your WinUI 3 solution in Visual Studio 2022
2. Right-click on your packaged app project (the one with `.Package` in its name) in Solution Explorer
3. Select **Properties**
4. Go to the **Debug** tab
5. Under **Start options**, select **Remote Machine**
6. Enter the name or IP address of your remote machine
7. Configure authentication if needed (typically Windows Authentication)

### Step 4: Modify Your Project File for Remote Deployment

Add the following to your project file (`.csproj`) to enable remote deployment. Open your project file by right-clicking on your project and selecting "Edit Project File":

```xml name=YourApp.csproj
<PropertyGroup>
  <!-- Add this section to your existing PropertyGroup or create a new one -->
  <DeployOptionalPackages>false</DeployOptionalPackages>
  <AppxPackageSigningEnabled>false</AppxPackageSigningEnabled>
  <RemoteDeployEnabled>true</RemoteDeployEnabled>
  <RemoteDeployMachine>YOUR_REMOTE_MACHINE_NAME_OR_IP</RemoteDeployMachine>
  <RemoteDeployDrive>C:</RemoteDeployDrive>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### Step 5: Create a PowerShell Deployment Script (Optional)

For more control over deployment, you can create a PowerShell script:

```powershell name=Deploy-Remote.ps1
param(
    [string]$RemoteMachine = "REMOTE-PC",
    [string]$PackagePath = ".\AppPackages\HorizontalListDemo_1.0.0.0_x64_Debug_Test",
    [string]$CertPath = ".\AppPackages\HorizontalListDemo_1.0.0.0_x64_Debug.cer"
)

# Variables
$AppxPackage = Get-ChildItem -Path $PackagePath -Filter "*.msix" | Select-Object -First 1
$AppxBundlePath = $AppxPackage.FullName
$AppxName = $AppxPackage.BaseName

# Remove existing app package
Write-Host "Removing existing app package (if any) on remote machine..."
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $RemoteMachine -ScriptBlock {
    param($AppxName)
    Get-AppxPackage -Name *$AppxName* | Remove-AppxPackage -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
} -ArgumentList $AppxName

# Create remote directory for package
Write-Host "Creating directory on remote machine..."
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $RemoteMachine -ScriptBlock {
    if (!(Test-Path "C:\Temp")) {
        New-Item -Path "C:\Temp" -ItemType Directory
    }
    if (!(Test-Path "C:\Temp\AppDeployment")) {
        New-Item -Path "C:\Temp\AppDeployment" -ItemType Directory
    }
}

# Copy files to remote machine
Write-Host "Copying application package files to remote machine..."
Copy-Item -Path "$AppxBundlePath" -Destination "\\$RemoteMachine\C$\Temp\AppDeployment\" -Force
Copy-Item -Path "$CertPath" -Destination "\\$RemoteMachine\C$\Temp\AppDeployment\" -Force

# Install certificate and deploy app
Write-Host "Installing certificate and deploying app on remote machine..."
Invoke-Command -ComputerName $RemoteMachine -ScriptBlock {
    Import-Certificate -FilePath "C:\Temp\AppDeployment\$($args[0])" -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople
    Add-AppxPackage -Path "C:\Temp\AppDeployment\$($args[1])"
} -ArgumentList (Split-Path $CertPath -Leaf), (Split-Path $AppxBundlePath -Leaf)

Write-Host "Deployment complete!"
```

### Step 6: Deploy and Debug

1. Build your application in Debug or Release mode
2. Deploy your application by right-clicking on the package project and selecting **Deploy**
3. Alternatively, press F5 to deploy and start debugging

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Connection Issues**:
   - Ensure both machines are on the same network
   - Check Windows Firewall settings on the remote machine
   - Verify Remote Debugger is running on the test machine

2. **Authentication Issues**:
   - Ensure the user accounts have appropriate permissions
   - Try using specific credentials in the project properties

3. **Deployment Failures**:
   - Check Event Viewer on the remote machine for detailed error information
   - Verify Developer Mode is enabled on the remote machine
   - Ensure the certificate is trusted on the remote machine

### Using Visual Studio's Remote Debugging Tools

1. In Visual Studio, go to **Debug** > **Attach to Process...**
2. In the **Connection type** dropdown, select **Remote (no authentication)**
3. In the **Connection target** field, enter your remote machine name or IP
4. Click **Find** to see available processes
5. Select your app's process and click **Attach**

This setup allows you to deploy and debug your WinUI 3 application on a remote test machine directly from Visual Studio, making it easier to test your application in different environments.
